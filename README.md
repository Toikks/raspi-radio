# raspi-radio

# Version with salvaged parts
Software raspberry pi radio control.
piRx.py is for receiver, and piTx.py is for transmitter.

This software is used for testing purposes and is made for Raspberry pi B controlling a radio receiver and Raspberry pi 3 controlling a radio transmitter salvaged from R/C helicopter toy.

Transmitter/Receiver pair uses ASK modulation at 27,095 Mhz. Maximum speed cannot exceed 1,5 ms per bit due to relays used for interfacing GPIO with external signal. 

This is one of the first python codes I have implemented in something useful. It's written with very low experience, but does reliably what it's supposed to.

# Version with fs1000a
coming soon
